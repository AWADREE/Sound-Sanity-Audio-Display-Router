## ÔøΩ Blacklist Manager

The Blacklist Manager allows you to control which applications should be excluded from automatic audio alignment.

### **How to Access**
- Available through the **Settings** menu in the system tray

### **How it Works**

- **Custom Control**: You can uncheck system processes to enable alignment on them if needed

### **Important Notes**
- **System processes** that you uncheck **will NOT be aligned** using **Auto Align**
- **Manual alignment** still works: Use **üíª Align All** button or **Align Selected** to Align these applications
- **Use Cases**: Perfect for applications you want to keep on a specific audio device (like music players, communication apps, or system sounds)
